# 2025 SW-Centric Universities Digital Contest: Text Discrimination Challenge

## 1. Overview

With the recent advancement of Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text. To address societal issues like the spread of misinformation and public opinion manipulation, this project aims to develop an AI model that predicts the probability of a given text being generated by AI.

The goal is to develop reliable AI-generated content detection technology, contributing to the responsible use of AI and restoring trust in digital information.

## 2. Problem Definition

* **Objective**: Develop an AI model to predict the probability (from 0 to 1) that a given **paragraph** of text was written by a generative AI.
* **Unique Labeling Scheme**:
    * **Training Data**: Labeled at the **full-text** level. If even a single paragraph in a document is AI-generated, the entire document is labeled as 'AI-written (1)'. Paragraph-level labels are not provided.
    * **Evaluation Data**: Provided at the **paragraph** level. The model must submit a probability for each individual paragraph.
* **Core Challenge**: The key challenge is to perform paragraph-level prediction using document-level **weak labels**.
* **Additional Rule**: Using context from other paragraphs within the same document (grouped by `title`) is permitted and encouraged for inference.
